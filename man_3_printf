TH _PRINTF "28 Mars 2024" "1.0" "printf man page"

.SH NAME
_printf - Reproduce the printf function

.SH SYNOPSIS
#include "main.h"

int _printf(const char *format, ...);

.SH DESCRIPTION

_printf is a function that reproduces the functionality of the standard C library printf function. It takes a format string and optional arguments and prints the formatted output to the standard output stream.

The format string can contain conversion specifiers that begin with a '%' character, followed by optional flags, width, precision, and length modifiers, and finally a conversion specifier character that specifies the type of data to be printed.

The following conversion specifiers are supported:

%c      Print a single character.
%s      Print a string.
%%      Print a '%' character.

.SH RETURN VALUE
Upon successful completion, _printf returns the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to terminate output to strings). If an output error is encountered, a negative value is returned.

.SH EXAMPLES
The following example demonstrates the usage of _printf:

#include "main.h"

int main(void) {
    _printf("Hello, %s!\n", "world");
    return (0);
}
